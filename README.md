# ClassRoster
## An entire console-based <span style="color: blue;">MVC CRUD application</span>    
### We'll build this project following the <span style="color: blue;">Agile</span>checklist and will organize it using tiered application design and MVC patterns.
### We will build an application that manages a roster of students. The user will be able to create, view, and delete students in the system and all student data will be persisted to a file. Here are the use cases:

* Add Student
* View All Students
* View a Single Student
* Remove Student

### Further, there is a requirement that the application store all of the student data in a file so that student data persists between times the Student Roster application is run.
