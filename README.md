<p align="center">✍️ <strong> An entire console-based <span style="color: red;">MVC CRUD application </strong></p>
<p align="center">✍️ <strong> We'll build this project following the <span style="color: red;">Agile</span> checklist and will organize it using tiered application design and MVC patterns. </strong></p>

<p align="center">✍️ <strong> We will build an application that manages a roster of students. The user will be able to create, view, and delete students in the system and all student data will be persisted to a file. Here are the use cases:  </strong></p>
<strong><ol>
  <li>Add Student</li>
  <li>View All Students</li>
  <li>View a Single Student</li>
  <li>Remove Student</li>
</ol></strong>

<p align="center">✍️ <strong> Further, there is a requirement that the application store all of the student data in a file so that student data persists between times the Student Roster application is run. </strong></p>
<p align="center">✍️ <strong> The Service Layer was implemented for the business logic of the application. </strong></p>
